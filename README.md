# AI-Driven Honeypot Project

## Overview  
This project implements a smart honeypot designed to attract attackers, log their actions, and dynamically adapt its behavior using AI to confuse them. The honeypot mimics a vulnerable system and tracks attack attempts while utilizing AI (via Hugging Face API) for real-time analysis and deception. Additionally, real-time alerts are sent using Gmail when attacks are detected.

## Purpose and Motivation  
In today's digital landscape, cyber attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Traditional security measures often struggle to keep pace with evolving threats. This project serves two primary purposes:  

1. **Research and Learning**:  
   - To understand attacker behavior and tactics in a controlled environment.  
   - To experiment with AI-driven techniques for analyzing and responding to cyber threats.  
   - To gain insights into the efficacy of honeypots as an active defense mechanism.

2. **Active Defense and Deception**:  
   - To build a system that not only detects but also actively confounds attackers by dynamically adapting its responses.  
   - To collect and analyze attack data that can inform future security strategies.  
   - To demonstrate how integrating AI can enhance traditional cybersecurity tools and create a more proactive defense strategy.

This project is an important step towards innovative cybersecurity solutions that leverage modern AI capabilities to anticipate and mitigate threats before they cause significant harm.

### Key Features  
- **Deceptive Services**: Fake SSH, HTTP, or FTP servers that attract attackers.  
- **AI-Based Attack Analysis**: Leverages Hugging Face's API to analyze attack logs and understand attack strategies.  
- **Adaptive Responses**: Dynamically adjusts the honeypot's behavior to confuse attackers.  
- **Logs and Visualizations**: Tracks and visualizes attacker activity using Kibana and Elasticsearch.  
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends email alerts via Gmail when an attack occurs.

## Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed and configured:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Docker** (for containerized honeypot and services)
- **Elasticsearch & Kibana** (for monitoring and visualizing logs)
- **Flask** (for API to expose logs)
- **Hugging Face API** (for AI-driven analysis)
- **Gmail API** (for sending email alerts)

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Cowrie**: SSH honeypot framework  
- **Flask**: Lightweight Python framework for building APIs  
- **Hugging Face API**: AI-driven analysis for attack pattern detection and dynamic responses  
- **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): For logging and visualizations of attack data  
- **Gmail API**: For email alerts when an attack is detected

## Installation  

1. **Install Dependencies**  

pip install flask openai requests cowrie elasticsearch


## Files for the Project
- **adaptive_honeypot.py**: Handles the AI-driven deception and dynamic response generation based on attack patterns.
